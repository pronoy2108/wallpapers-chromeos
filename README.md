# wallpapers-chromeos
A collection of Chrome OS simply beautiful wallpapers.

Forked from another GitHub repo:
[https://github.com/xXiNiXx1/wallpapers-chromeos](https://github.com/xXiNiXx1/wallpapers-chromeos)

This is an extract of all wallpapers found on [http://www.chromeup.com/chrome-os-wallpapers/](http://www.chromeup.com/chrome-os-wallpapers/). Since this website is in archive mode and no longer being maintained, I wanted to have a backup of those wonderful Chrome OS wallpapers. 

Update: I have added many new wallpapers to this repo....

**Disclaimer:** I do not own anything of these images, all images are the property of their respective photographers and/or creators.
